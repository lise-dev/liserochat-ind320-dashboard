## Project Overview
This repository contains my project work for the course **IND320: Data to Decision**.  
The project is divided into four parts, each building on the previous one, and will result in a final portfolio and an interactive dashboard app.  

## Repository Structure
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter Notebooks (analysis, plots, documentation)  
- `app/` → Streamlit app files  
- `requirements.txt` → Dependencies for running the app  
- `data/` → CSV or other data files used in the project  
- `docs/` → Reports 

## How to Run Locally
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lise-dev/liserochat-ind320-dashboard.git
   cd liserochat-ind320-dashboard
   ```
2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```

## AI Usage
AI tools were used mainly for:  
- Improving English writing in the README and project log  
- Debugging code and solving errors  
- Getting explanations of concepts and functions  

All implementation, testing, and final decisions were done by me.
